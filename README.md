## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Optional] [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), LM Studio, or API keys for Cloud Providers

### Installation

#### 🐧 Linux / Ubuntu (recommended)

Use the automated install script — it checks and installs every system package, Python dependency, and optional LLM SDK:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianx26/zensynora.git
cd zensynora
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The script handles:
- ✅ System packages (`python3`, `pip`, `venv`, `git`, `curl`, `sqlite3`, etc.)
- ✅ Python ≥ 3.10 (auto-upgrades via deadsnakes PPA if needed)
- ✅ Virtual environment creation & activation
- ✅ All pip dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Optional LLM SDKs (Anthropic, Gemini — prompted interactively)
- ✅ Optional [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) install for local models
- ✅ Required data directories (`~/.myclaw/`)
- ✅ Optional systemd service to auto-start the Telegram gateway on boot
- ✅ Final import verification of all installed packages

#### 🪟 Windows / Manual

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adrianx26/zensynora.git
cd zensynora

# Create & activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux (manual)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Run the onboarding wizard
python cli.py onboard
```

Edit `~/.myclaw/config.json` to configure:
- Telegram bot token (get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Your Telegram user ID (use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
- WhatsApp Business credentials (see [WhatsApp Setup Guide](plans/whatsapp_implementation_plan.md#step-1-create-a-meta-developer-account))
- **Providers:** Configure APIs for Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, LM Studio, or llama.cpp.

### Running

**Console Mode:**
```bash
python cli.py agent
```

**Telegram Gateway:**
```bash
# First, ensure your chosen provider is running or configured
ollama run llama3.2

# Then start the Telegram bot
python cli.py gateway
```

**WhatsApp Gateway:**
```bash
# First, ensure your chosen provider is running or configured
ollama run llama3.2

# Then start the WhatsApp webhook server
python cli.py gateway
# Requires WhatsApp enabled in config and a public webhook URL (use ngrok for dev)

### 🤖 Intelligence & Benchmarking (v0.5)

ZenSynora now includes a proactive Intelligence Platform that grows automatically and optimizes itself based on task requirements.

#### 🖥️ Hardware Awareness & Optimization
ZenSynora monitors your system resources to ensure optimal agent performance.
- **Telemetry**: CPU (specs/temp), RAM (size/usage), GPU (model/vram/load), NPU, and Network latency.
- **Diagnostics**: Run `python cli.py hardware` for a full diagnostic report.
- **Auto-Suggestions**: The agent proactively warns if your selected model exceeds physical RAM or VRAM limits.

#### 🛤️ Intelligent Routing (Phase 1.5)
ZenSynora now features a sophisticated dynamic dispatch system that selects the best model for ogni task.
- **Intent Analysis**: Automatically detects if a query requires deep reasoning, coding, or just a quick chat.
- **Free-First Logic**: Prioritize local hardware (Ollama) or zero-cost APIs (Groq/Gemini Flash) to minimize your wallet impact.
- **Provider Allowlists**: Complete control over which models and providers are allowed to participate in auto-routing.
- **Auto-Disable**: Overlays zero overhead when only a single model is configured.
- **Hardware-Aware**: Integrates with system telemetry to avoid heavy local models on RAM-constrained machines.

#### 🔍 Automatic Knowledge Research
When the agent detects a "knowledge gap" during a user query, it logs it for background research. A worker runs every 6 hours (configurable) and uses the `scrapling` engine to find information on the web, synthesizing it into a new Knowledge Base entry.
*   **Idle Check**: Research only runs when the system has been idle for 15+ minutes to ensure zero performance impact while you work.

#### 📊 Performance Benchmarking
You can evaluate how different models perform on accuracy, latency, and token usage tasks:
```bash
# Run full benchmark suite
python cli.py benchmark

# Benchmark a specific model
python cli.py benchmark --model gpt-4o --provider openai
```

- **GPU Cloud**: Deploy on RunPod, Vast.ai, or similar GPU cloud providers
- **Home Server**: Access Ollama running on a home server via reverse proxy

**Security Note**: When exposing Ollama to the internet, use HTTPS and consider adding authentication via a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.).

### Creating Named Agents

Add agents to the `agents.named` array in your config. Each agent can have:
- `name` — Agent identifier (use with `@name` prefix)
- `provider` — The LLM provider to use (e.g., `openai`, `ollama`)
- `model` — Provider-specific model name
- `system_prompt` — Custom system instructions

**Per-Agent Prompt Profiles:**
Alternatively, an agent's individual system prompt can be managed via dedicated Markdown files instead of the config. MyClaw will automatically load the prompt from profile files upon startup. This allows for rich, multi-line instructions easily.

**Profile Loading Priority:**
1. **Local Workspace** (checked first): `myclaw/profiles/{name}.md`
2. **User Home** (fallback): `~/.myclaw/profiles/{name}.md`
3. **Config** (final fallback): `system_prompt` from config.json

**Built-in Profiles:**
The following profile templates are included in `myclaw/profiles/`:
- `default.md` — Default agent with all capabilities
- `agent.md` — Core agent capabilities reference
- `soul.md` — Ethical guidelines and principles
- `identity.md` — Agent personality and communication style
- `user.md` — User preferences template
- `heartbeat.md` — System monitoring and health checks
- `bootstrap.md` — Initialization and startup sequence
- `memory.md` — Memory management guidelines

```

### Adding Custom Tools (TOOLBOX)

MyClaw includes a **TOOLBOX** system for creating, storing, and sharing custom tools between agents.

#### TOOLBOX Features

- **Centralized Storage**: All custom tools are stored in `~/.myclaw/TOOLBOX/`
- **Documentation Required**: Each tool must include documentation and a README
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Agents must check for existing tools before creating new ones
- **Error Logging**: Built-in error logging system for debugging and improvement
- **Version Control**: Each tool tracks its creation date and errors

#### Creating Tools

When an agent creates a tool using `register_tool(name, code, documentation)`, it must:

1. **Check for Duplicates**: Use `list_toolbox()` first to see if a similar tool exists
2. **Include Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation explaining the tool's purpose
3. **Add Error Handling**: Code must include try-except blocks
4. **Log Errors**: Use `logger.error()` for error logging
5. **Include Docstring**: Code must have a proper docstring

Example:
```python
register_tool(
    "calculate_sum",
    '''def calculate_sum(a, b):
        """Calculate the sum of two numbers.
        
        Args:
            a: First number
            b: Second number
            
        Returns:
            The sum of a and b
        """
        try:
            result = a + b
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in calculate_sum: {e}")
            return f"Error: {e}"
    ''',
    "Tool to calculate the sum of two numbers with proper error handling"
)
```

#### TOOLBOX Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list_toolbox()` | List all tools in TOOLBOX with metadata |
| `get_tool_documentation(name)` | Get detailed docs for a specific tool |
| `register_tool(name, code, docs)` | Create and store a new tool |

#### Tool Storage

- **Code**: `~/.myclaw/TOOLBOX/{tool_name}.py`
- **Documentation**: `~/.myclaw/TOOLBOX/{tool_name}_README.md`
- **Registry**: `~/.myclaw/TOOLBOX/toolbox_registry.json`
- **Master README**: `~/.myclaw/TOOLBOX/README.md`

### Internet & Download Tools

MyClaw now includes built-in tools for browsing the internet and downloading files:

| Tool | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `browse(url, max_length)` | Browse a URL, strip HTML and return plain text | `browse("https://example.com")` |
| `download_file(url, path)` | Download a file to workspace | `download_file("https://example.com/file.pdf", "downloads/file.pdf")` |

These tools include:
- Automatic User-Agent headers
- Timeout protection (30s for browse, 60s for download)
- **HTML stripping** — `browse()` removes script/style blocks and all HTML tags, returning clean plain text
- Path validation for security
- Error handling and logging

### Cleanup

A `cleanup.sh` script is provided to remove temporary files:

```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```

This will:
- Remove test files (`test_*.py`)
- Remove temporary files (`*.tmp`)
- Remove downloaded archives (`*.zip`)
- Remove Putty tools directory (`putty/`)
- Remove pytest cache (`__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`)

### Shell Allowed Commands

The `shell()` tool enforces a strict allowlist for security:

```
ls, dir, cat, type, find, grep, findstr, head, tail, wc, sort, uniq, cut, git,
echo, pwd, python, python3, pip, curl, wget
```

Edit `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` in `myclaw/tools.py` to customize.

### Agent Skills Evaluation

MyClaw includes an autoresearch-inspired evaluation harness to score and improve agent skills.

#### Skill Reference

All agent skills are documented in [`myclaw/skills.md`](myclaw/skills.md) with:
- Per-skill I/O contracts, edge cases, and known limitations
- Scoring rubric: `Score = 0.4×Correctness + 0.3×Reliability + 0.2×Clarity + 0.1×Coverage`
- Version history with baseline vs improved scores

**Current evaluation results (v0.1):**
| Metric | Baseline | Improved |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Overall avg score | 0.880 | **0.989** |
| Tasks passing | 25/25| **25/25** |

#### Running Evaluations

```bash
# Run baseline evaluation
python eval/eval_agent_skills.py --mode baseline

# Run improved evaluation
python eval/eval_agent_skills.py --mode improved

# Compare baseline vs improved (KEEP / DISCARD verdict)
python eval/eval_agent_skills.py --compare eval/results/baseline_results.tsv eval/results/improved_results.tsv
```

Results are saved to `eval/results/` as TSV files.

## 📝 Behavioral Changes (v2.1)

### Knowledge Base Empty Results
When `search_knowledge()` finds no matching entries, it now returns an actionable guidance payload instead of a simple "No results" message. The payload includes:
- Confirmation that no results were found
- Suggested broader search terms derived from the query
- Explicit pointers to `write_to_knowledge()` and `list_knowledge()` tools
- Tips for improving search results

**Backward Compatibility**: Existing code that checks for "No results found" in the return string will continue to work. The new guidance text includes this phrase.

### Browse Tool Error Handling
The `browse()` tool now returns structured error payloads with actionable guidance instead of raw exception messages for common failure modes:
- **Timeout**: Suggests Wayback Machine cached version from web.archive.org
- **ConnectionError**: Advises checking internet connection
- **404**: Suggests web search alternatives and Wayback Machine
- **403**: Recommends using `search_knowledge()` instead

**Backward Compatibility**: All error cases still return a string; the format is more user-friendly. Code checking for "Error" prefix will continue to work.

### Knowledge Gap Logging
The agent now logs knowledge gaps (queries with no results) to a dedicated logger (`myclaw.knowledge.gaps`). Duplicate gaps within the same session are deduplicated to prevent log noise. The `_search_knowledge_context()` method now supports returning structured results via the `return_structured=True` parameter.

**For Developers**: 
- Test hooks available: `Agent._knowledge_gap_cache_enabled` (class-level) and `Agent.set_gap_cache_enabled()` (instance-level)
- Use `Agent.clear_gap_cache()` in tests to reset deduplication state

---

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- The agent executes shell commands—review the allowlist in [`myclaw/tools.py`](myclaw/tools.py:19)
- File operations are restricted to the workspace directory (`~/.myclaw/workspace`)
- Telegram access is controlled by user ID whitelist
- Always review what the agent executes, especially with shell commands
